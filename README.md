# PacMan
Factory for making pacmen
You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.

## How To
Load the starter.html page. From here you can interact with the game by adding Pacmen and starting the game. Future improvements include adding css grid structure to move
the PacMen along a line to "consume" fruits. It also includes PacMen appearing on several grid rows to move along for this purpose.
